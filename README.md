The assignment says that we need to make a webshop that contains the following features (With OK is Finished)
### Homepage
- All four random featured products
- All four new products
### Products overview page
- Overview of all products
- This page also contains a filter to filter products by category and this
WITHOUT reload the page.
- A product has a photo, a name, a price and a category
- If we move about the mouse, you get a cart
see button. If you click on this button, the product is effective in your
Cart rightly WITHOUT reload the page.
### Product detail page
- A product has a name, description, photo, category and price
- Again, you have a button to add the product to the cart.
This too should be done WITHOUT reload the page.
- At the bottom of this page you will get a list of four products in the same
are catgegorie. (Of course, the current product may not be shown)
- The manager of the shop itself has the ability to provide products and
add categories to the website. For each product, he gets the
possibility of lifting it out.
- Users can give a rating on a product and also here
Linking feedback / comment on.
### Contact page
- Users can leave a message through the mail to the administrator
will be sent.
### Shopping page
- All products users are on this page to their
cart. From this page the user can follow the workflow you
Purchasing effective. The checkout workflow must include:
o Billing Address
o Deliver Address (with the possibility to check: Use billing address)
o Delivery Method
o Payment
o Acceptance of Terms and Conditions
- After the checkout page they get all the data (Cart
content, billing address, delivery address, ...)

### General
- The administrator of the site should be able to get an overview to
Watching all orders in his shop. He must also details of all
view orders.
- Users must log in to qualify for a rating and products
order. So for that we have at least their name, first name and email address
required. Give the user the option to remain logged in. That means,
the next time he visits your shop, he does not have to log in.
- Make sure that your basket remains filled, even if you leave the user
website. If the user closes the browser entirely, then allowed the
cart is emptied.
- Of course, any form both client-side to send the server side after
posting validated.
- All code you write conforms as closely as possible to the HTML5 standard.
- Do not spend too much time on the design of the website, functionality
priority. This does not mean that a website without any formatting is sufficient.
- Note: indentation of your code clearly commenting on your source code,
both HTML, JS and PHP, using logic and variable names
function names, minimize code duplication as much as possible PHP, HTML and
separate JS ...
- No PHP or JS frameworks may be used only jQuery. You may
possibly use a CSS framework like bootrstrap or foundation.
